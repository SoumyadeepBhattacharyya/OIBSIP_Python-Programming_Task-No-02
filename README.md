# OIBSIP_Python-Programming_Task-No-02
Objective :  The purpose of this program is to take weight (kg) and height (meter) from the user, calculate BMI, and show the health category based on BMI value.

Steps Performed : 
                  1. User enters weight and height.  
                  2. Program checks if the inputs are valid (positive numbers).
                  3. BMI is calculated using the formula:
                          BMI = Weight / (height * height)
                  4. Based on BMI value, the category is shown:
                          4.1. BMI < 18.5 → Underweight
                          4.2. 18.5 – 24.9 → Normal
                          4.3. 25 – 29.9 → Overweight
                          4.4. ≥ 30 → Obese
                  5. Program displays the BMI value and category to the user.

Tools Used : 
                  1. Python Programming Language.
                  2. Functions (calculate_bmi) → For modular calculation.
                  3. Input/Output functions (input(), print()) → For user interaction.
                  4. Exception Handling (try-except) → To handle wrong inputs safely.
                  5. Conditional Statements (if-elif-else) → For BMI categorization.

Outcome : 
                  1. The program successfully calculates BMI based on user input.
                  2. It ensures safe input handling (avoids crashes if wrong values are entered).
                  3. Finally, it gives a clear health category message to the user (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
